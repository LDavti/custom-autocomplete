# Custom Autocomplete Component

Custom Autocomplete Component with only pure React and internal DOM
functions on Typescript. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `vite`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open the host in your terminal to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `preview`

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running npm run preview command. The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173 . It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
